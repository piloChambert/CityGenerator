# CityGenerator

##Description
A road generators, based on  Parish and Müller's paper https://graphics.ethz.ch/Downloads/Publications/Papers/2001/p_Par01.pdf

It doesn't use an LSystem at all, as explained by Sean Barrett (http://nothings.org/gamedev/l_systems.html), which makes it way more easier to implement!

The code is in Lua, and Lua/Löve (https://love2d.org/) is used for rendering.
